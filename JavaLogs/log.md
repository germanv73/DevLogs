**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Link(s) to work**: [Calculator App](http://www.example.com)

**Progress**: Initiated a terminal program that consists of a library/book store system. This program will keep basic book information such as, author, publisher, genre and price. No input prompts will be made, all information will be hardcoded into the program. An array will exist which contains a quantity for each book sold and will prompt a list of each book sold and the total charge for each book.
